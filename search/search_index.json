It is analyzed as two separate motions in horizontal and vertical directions. 1. Assumptions in Projectile Motion: The only force acting on the projectile (neglecting air resistance) is gravity \\(g = 9.81 \\, m/s^2\\) . The motion is independent in horizontal and vertical directions . The horizontal motion has constant velocity (no acceleration). The vertical motion has uniform acceleration due to gravity. 2. Equations of Motion: Let: \\(v_0\\) = initial velocity \\(\\theta\\) = launch angle \\(v_{0x} = v_0 \\cos\\theta\\) (initial horizontal velocity) \\(v_{0y} = v_0 \\sin\\theta\\) (initial vertical velocity) \\(g = 9.81 \\, m/s^2\\) (acceleration due to gravity) \\(t\\) = time \\(x\\) = horizontal displacement \\(y\\) = vertical displacement Horizontal Motion (Constant Velocity): $$ x = v_{0x} t = (v_0 \\cos\\theta) t $$ $$ v_x = v_0 \\cos\\theta $$ \\(\\Rightarrow\\) No acceleration in the horizontal direction. Vertical Motion (Accelerated Motion due to Gravity): $$ y = v_{0y} t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 $$ $$ v_y = v_{0y} - g t $$ \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Velocity decreases until the projectile reaches the highest point, then increases downward. 3. Key Parameters in Projectile Motion: (a) Time of Flight (Total time the projectile remains in the air) $$ T = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g} $$ derived from setting \\(y = 0\\) when the projectile lands (b) Maximum Height (Highest point reached by the projectile) $$ H = \\frac{(v_0 \\sin\\theta)^2}{2g} $$ (derived by setting \\(v_y = 0\\) at the peak) (c) Range (Total horizontal distance covered) $$ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{g} $$ (This is maximized when $\\theta = 45^\\circ $ 4. Summary: The horizontal component remains constant \\(x = v_{0x} t\\) The vertical component follows free-fall motion under gravity \\(y = v_{0y} t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2\\) . The time of flight, maximum height, and range depend on the initial velocity and angle of projection. The trajectory is a symmetric parabola .

By introducing both damping and external periodic forcing, the system demonstrates a transition from simple harmonic motion to a rich spectrum of dynamics, including resonance, chaos, and quasiperiodic behavior. These phenomena serve as a foundation for understanding complex real-world systems, such as driven oscillators, climate systems, and mechanical structures under periodic stress. Adding forcing introduces new parameters, such as the amplitude and frequency of the external force, which significantly affect the pendulum's behavior. By systematically varying these parameters, a diverse class of solutions can be observed, including synchronized oscillations, chaotic motion, and resonance phenomena. These behaviors not only highlight fundamental physics principles but also provide insights into engineering applications such as energy harvesting, vibration isolation, and mechanical resonance. Task 1. Theoretical Foundation Start with the differential equation governing the motion of a forced damped pendulum: $$ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + b \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\sin\\theta = A \\cos(\\omega t) $$ Derive the approximate solutions for small-angle oscillations. Explore resonance conditions and their implications for the system's energy. 2. Analysis of Dynamics Investigate how the damping coefficient, driving amplitude, and driving frequency influence the motion of the pendulum. Examine the transition between regular and chaotic motion and their physical interpretations. 3.
