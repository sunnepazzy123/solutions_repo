This relationship is derived from Kepler's Third Law of Planetary Motion. This document will explain this relationship, provide a computational model to simulate circular orbits, and analyze real-world examples such as the Moon's orbit around Earth and the orbits of planets in the Solar System. Additionally, the document will explore the implications of this relationship for astronomy, including the role it plays in calculating planetary masses and distances. 1. Deriving the Relationship Between Orbital Period and Orbital Radius For a celestial body in a circular orbit, we can describe the orbit using Newton's version of Kepler's Third Law: \\[ T^2 \\propto R^3 \\] Where: - \\(T\\) is the orbital period (time taken for one full orbit), - \\(R\\) is the orbital radius (the distance from the central body to the orbiting body), - The constant of proportionality depends on the mass of the central body and the gravitational constant. Derivation: We start with the formula for gravitational force: \\[ F = \\frac{G M m}{R^2} \\] Where: - \\(G\\) is the gravitational constant, - \\(M\\) is the mass of the central body (e.g., the Sun, Earth), - \\(m\\) is the mass of the orbiting body (e.g., a planet, the Moon), - \\(R\\) is the orbital radius. This gravitational force provides the centripetal force required for circular motion: \\[ F = \\frac{m v^2}{R} \\] Where \\(v\\) is the orbital velocity of the body. Equating the two forces: \\[ \\frac{G M m}{R^2} = \\frac{m v^2}{R} \\] Simplifying: \\[ v^2 = \\frac{G M}{R} \\] The orbital velocity \\(v\\) is also related to the orbital period \\(T\\) by: \\[ v = \\frac{2 \\pi R}{T} \\] Substituting into the equation: \\[ \\left(\\frac{2 \\pi R}{T}\\right)^2 = \\frac{G M}{R} \\] Simplifying further: \\[ \\frac{4 \\pi^2 R^2}{T^2} = \\frac{G M}{R} \\] \\[ T^2 = \\frac{4 \\pi^2 R^3}{G M} \\] This shows that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the orbital radius: \\[ T^2 \\propto R^3 \\] This equation is known as Kepler's Third Law , and it holds true for any body orbiting a central mass under the influence of gravity in a circular orbit. 2. Implications of the Relationship This relationship has significant implications for astronomy: Calculating Planetary Distances: By observing the orbital period \\(T\\) and using Kepler's Third Law, astronomers can calculate the orbital radius \\(R\\) of a planet, moon, or other celestial body. Estimating Planetary Masses: By measuring the orbital period and radius, we can calculate the mass of the central body (e.g., a planet or star). This is important for understanding the structure of planetary systems and stars. Understanding Orbital Mechanics: The relationship also helps in predicting the motion of satellites and other objects in orbit, including artificial satellites and space probes. 3. Real-World Examples 3.1 The Moon's Orbit Around Earth The Moon orbits Earth with an average orbital radius of approximately 384,400 km and an orbital period of 27.3 days. Using Kepler's Third Law, we can verify the relationship between the orbital period and the orbital radius for the Moon's orbit. 3.2 Planets in the Solar System Kepler's Third Law applies not only to moons but also to planets. For instance, Earth's orbital radius is about 149.6 million km (1 AU), and its orbital period is 365.25 days. By using this law, we can calculate the orbital periods of other planets in the Solar System. 4. Computational Model to Simulate Circular Orbits We can simulate circular orbits and verify the relationship between the orbital period and orbital radius using Python. The following script implements this simulation and graphs the results. Here's the graph showing the relationship between the square of the orbital period (T\u00b2) and the cube of the orbital radius (R\u00b3), based on Kepler's third law. As expected, the plot demonstrates a linear relationship between the two quantities. 5. Discussion on Elliptical Orbits and Other Celestial Bodies Kepler's Third Law applies not only to circular orbits but also to elliptical orbits. However, for elliptical orbits, the relationship is slightly modified, as the orbital radius changes over time. The semi-major axis \\(a\\) of the ellipse, which represents the average orbital radius, is used in the formula instead of the orbital radius \\(R\\) : \\[ T^2 \\propto a^3 \\] This extension allows the calculation of orbital periods for objects in elliptical orbits, such as comets. Conclusion Kepler's Third Law provides a foundational understanding of the relationship between a celestial body's orbital period and its orbital radius. This law is crucial for calculating distances, masses, and understanding the dynamics of planetary systems and artificial satellites. By implementing a computational model and visualizing the relationship, we verify the law's accuracy and gain insights into orbital mechanics, both for circular and elliptical orbits.","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_1/#markdown-document-the-relationship-between-orbital-period-and-orbital-radius","text":"","title":"Markdown Document: The Relationship Between Orbital Period and Orbital Radius"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_1/#introduction","text":"In astronomy, understanding the relationship between a planet's orbital period and its orbital radius is fundamental for calculating various orbital characteristics, such as the distance of celestial bodies from their central objects (e.g., the distance between Earth and the Sun) and estimating the masses of planets and stars.

Cosmic Velocities Overview In the context of celestial mechanics, cosmic velocities describe the speeds required for various space missions. They are related to the velocity needed to overcome the gravitational pull of a celestial body and proceed on different orbital or escape paths. First Cosmic Velocity (Orbital Velocity) The first cosmic velocity is the speed at which an object must travel to enter a circular orbit around a planet or celestial body. This velocity allows the object to remain in orbit without falling back to the surface. The formula for the first cosmic velocity is: [ v_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{GM}{R}} ] Where: - \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant, - \\( M \\) is the mass of the celestial body, - \\( R \\) is the radius of the orbit (distance from the center of the celestial body). Second Cosmic Velocity (Escape Velocity) The second cosmic velocity is the speed an object must have to break free from the gravitational field of a planet or celestial body, without any further propulsion. The formula for the second cosmic velocity is: [ v_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{R}} ] Where: - \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant, - \\( M \\) is the mass of the celestial body, - \\( R \\) is the radius of the celestial body. Third Cosmic Velocity (Solar Escape Velocity) The third cosmic velocity is the speed required for an object to escape the gravitational pull of the entire solar system, and it is typically calculated at the distance of Earth's orbit from the Sun. The formula for the third cosmic velocity is: [ v_3 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM_{\\text{sun}}}{R_{\\text{sun}} + R}} ] Where: - \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant, - \\( M_{\\text{sun}} \\) is the mass of the Sun, - \\( R_{\\text{sun}} \\) is the radius of the Sun, - \\( R \\) is the distance from the center of the Earth (or the object) to the center of the Sun. 2. Parameters Affecting These Velocities Gravitational Constant (G) : This is a universal constant that plays a crucial role in all cosmic velocity formulas. Mass of the Celestial Body (M) : The greater the mass, the stronger the gravitational field, which increases the required velocity. Radius (R) : The closer an object is to the center of the celestial body (smaller radius), the higher the velocity needed to maintain orbit or escape. 3. Calculating and Visualizing Velocities for Different Bodies Example Calculation for Earth, Mars, and Jupiter: Let's calculate the velocities for Earth, Mars, and Jupiter. Celestial Body Parameters: - Earth : - Mass: \\( 5.97 \\times 10^{24} \\) kg, - Radius: \\( 6.37 \\times 10^6 \\) m, - Distance from Sun: \\( 1.496 \\times 10^{11} \\) m. Mars : Mass: \\( 6.42 \\times 10^{23} \\) kg, Radius: \\( 3.396 \\times 10^6 \\) m, Distance from Sun: \\( 2.279 \\times 10^{11} \\) m. Jupiter : Mass: \\( 1.90 \\times 10^{27} \\) kg, Radius: \\( 6.99 \\times 10^7 \\) m, Distance from Sun: \\( 7.785 \\times 10^{11} \\) m. Graphical Representation: For visualization, we can plot these velocities for each celestial body. The graphical representation will show: First Cosmic Velocity : Orbital velocity for each planet. Second Cosmic Velocity : Escape velocity for each planet. Third Cosmic Velocity : Solar escape velocity at the respective distance from the Sun. 4. Importance in Space Exploration These velocities are fundamental in: - Launching Satellites : The first cosmic velocity determines the speed required to place satellites into orbit. - Interplanetary Missions : The second cosmic velocity is crucial for launching probes or missions that need to leave a planet and travel to other planets or bodies in the solar system. - Interstellar Travel : The third cosmic velocity is the key to escaping the solar system and reaching other star systems, which is essential for potential interstellar travel in the future. Diagram: Here\u2019s a graphical diagram that visualizes the comparison of the first, second, and third cosmic velocities for Earth, Mars, and Jupiter. This image illustrates the concept of orbital velocity (first cosmic velocity) and escape velocity (second cosmic velocity) in relation to Earth.

The type of trajectory a payload follows depends on several factors, including its initial position, velocity, and the forces acting on it. This document explores different possible trajectories, such as parabolic, hyperbolic, and elliptical paths, and develops a computational tool to simulate these trajectories under Earth's gravity. We will use fundamental gravitational principles like Newton's Law of Gravitation and Kepler's Laws to analyze and simulate the motion of a payload. Numerical methods, such as the Runge-Kutta method, will be used for solving the equations of motion and visualizing the results. Gravitational Principles and Laws Newton\u2019s Law of Gravitation states that the force between two masses is given by: [ F = G \\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} ] Where: - \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant ( \\(6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{Nm}^2/\\text{kg}^2\\) ) - \\( m_1 \\) and \\( m_2 \\) are the masses of the two bodies (Earth and the payload) - \\( r \\) is the distance between the centers of the two masses Orbital Mechanics : Based on the energy of the payload, different trajectories arise: Elliptical Orbit : If the velocity is below escape velocity, the trajectory is elliptical. Parabolic Trajectory : If the velocity is exactly at escape velocity, the trajectory is parabolic. Hyperbolic Trajectory : If the velocity exceeds escape velocity, the trajectory is hyperbolic, resulting in escape from Earth\u2019s gravity. Kepler\u2019s Laws : These describe the motion of planets around the sun, and the principles can be applied to orbital mechanics: Orbits are ellipses with the center of mass at one focus. A line connecting a planet to the sun sweeps out equal areas in equal times. The square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. Numerical Analysis and Simulation To compute the path of the payload, we will solve the equations of motion numerically using the gravitational force. We'll simulate the motion of the payload under Earth's gravity, using the initial conditions like the position, velocity, and altitude. The motion will be analyzed for various trajectories. Equations of Motion The motion of the payload is governed by Newton's second law: \\[ \\vec{F} = m \\cdot \\vec{a} \\] The acceleration is given by the gravitational force divided by the mass of the payload: \\[ \\vec{a} = - \\frac{G M_{\\text{Earth}}}{r^2} \\hat{r} \\] Where: - \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant - \\( M_{\\text{Earth}} \\) is the mass of Earth - \\( r \\) is the distance between Earth and the payload - \\( \\hat{r} \\) is the unit vector in the radial direction Python Script: Simulating Payload Trajectories We will now implement the simulation using Python. We will solve the equations of motion numerically using the Runge-Kutta method. Explanation of the Diagram Initial Conditions : The initial position and velocity of the payload are provided in the code. The payload starts 500 km above Earth's surface with an initial velocity of 7.8 km/s (roughly the orbital velocity). Gravity Function : This function computes the acceleration due to gravity at each point in the trajectory. The force of gravity is calculated using Newton\u2019s law, and acceleration is obtained by dividing the force by the mass of the payload. Runge-Kutta Method : This numerical method is used to solve the system of differential equations (the motion equations) with a given time step. It computes the trajectory iteratively and stores the results at each time step. Plotting : The resulting trajectory is plotted in a 2D plane to visualize the path of the payload as it moves under the influence of Earth's gravity. Types of Trajectories Elliptical Orbit : If the initial velocity is less than the escape velocity, the payload will follow an elliptical orbit around the Earth. Parabolic Trajectory : At the exact escape velocity, the trajectory becomes parabolic, indicating that the payload will escape Earth's gravitational influence, but it will never return. Hyperbolic Trajectory : If the initial velocity exceeds the escape velocity, the payload follows a hyperbolic trajectory, which is characteristic of a gravitational escape trajectory. Visualizing Escape Velocity and Orbital Insertion Escape Velocity : The minimum velocity needed for an object to escape Earth's gravity. The escape velocity at Earth's surface is approximately 11.2 km/s. Orbital Insertion : Achieved when the payload reaches a stable orbit, typically requiring a velocity of about 7.8 km/s for low Earth orbit. Conclusion This simulation tool provides a simple yet effective way to visualize the motion of a payload under Earth's gravity. By adjusting the initial conditions, we can simulate different types of trajectories (elliptical, parabolic, hyperbolic) and understand their relevance in real-world space missions, such as orbital insertion, reentry, or escape. The computational tool can be expanded for more complex scenarios, such as multi-body gravitational interactions and perturbations due to the Moon or other celestial bodies.","title":"Problem 3"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_3/#problem-3","text":"","title":"Problem 3"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_3/#markdown-document-analyzing-payload-trajectories-near-earth","text":"","title":"Markdown Document: Analyzing Payload Trajectories Near Earth"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_3/#introduction","text":"The study of trajectories near Earth is crucial for space mission planning, satellite deployment, and understanding celestial mechanics.

Select a Regular Polygon Choose a regular polygon for simplicity. For this case, we will start with a square (4 sides). This can later be generalized to other polygons like an equilateral triangle or pentagon. 2. Position the Sources The wave sources are placed at the vertices of the chosen polygon. For a square with side length \\(a\\) , the vertices of the square are positioned at: \\( (0, 0) \\) \\( (a, 0) \\) \\( (a, a) \\) \\( (0, a) \\) 3. Wave Equations The wave emitted from each source is described by the following equation: [ \\psi(r, t) = A \\cdot \\cos(k \\cdot r - \\omega \\cdot t + \\phi) ] where: - \\( \\psi(r, t) \\) is the displacement of the water surface at point \\(r\\) (distance from the source) and time \\(t\\) . - \\( A \\) is the amplitude of the wave. - \\( k = \\frac{2 \\pi}{\\lambda} \\) is the wave number, related to the wavelength \\( \\lambda \\) . - \\( \\omega = 2 \\pi f \\) is the angular frequency, related to the frequency \\(f\\) . - \\( r \\) is the distance from the source to the point on the surface. - \\( \\phi \\) is the initial phase of the wave.

Superposition of Waves The principle of superposition tells us that the displacement at a point on the water surface due to multiple wave sources is the sum of the displacements from each individual source. If there are \\(N\\) sources located at the vertices of the polygon, the total displacement at a point \\( (x, y) \\) on the water surface is: [ \\psi_{\\text{total}}(x, y, t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\psi_i(x, y, t) ] Each term in the sum corresponds to the displacement from the wave source at vertex \\(i\\) , and we use the wave equation for each source. 5. Analysis of Interference Patterns Constructive interference occurs when the waves are in phase, leading to amplification of the wave at that point. Destructive interference occurs when the waves are out of phase, leading to cancellation at that point. We can observe regions of constructive and destructive interference by evaluating the total displacement \\( \\psi_{\\text{total}}(x, y, t) \\) across different points on the water surface. 6.

Exploration of Applications The Lorentz force describes the force experienced by a charged particle moving through an electric ( \\( \\mathbf{E} \\) ) and magnetic ( \\( \\mathbf{B} \\) ) field. This force is critical in various scientific and engineering fields, with numerous applications that rely on the interaction between charged particles and electromagnetic fields. Key Systems where the Lorentz Force Plays a Key Role: Particle Accelerators (e.g., Cyclotrons, Synchrotrons) : Charged particles are accelerated to high speeds using electric fields. The magnetic fields control the trajectory of the particles, bending their path in a circular or spiral motion. The Lorentz force is what keeps the particles on track and allows them to gain energy as they circulate in the accelerator. Mass Spectrometers : The motion of charged particles (ions) in a magnetic field is used to measure their mass-to-charge ratio. The trajectory of ions in the magnetic field is influenced by the Lorentz force, allowing for the separation of different ions based on their velocity and mass. Plasma Confinement (e.g., Tokamaks) : In plasma confinement devices, such as Tokamaks or Stellarators, charged particles are contained within a magnetic field to prevent them from escaping. The Lorentz force is used to steer and stabilize the motion of plasma particles in order to achieve controlled nuclear fusion. Magnetic Traps (e.g., Penning Traps) : The Lorentz force is utilized to trap charged particles using electric and magnetic fields, which is fundamental in experiments involving the manipulation and study of ions or electrons. Relevance of Electric and Magnetic Fields: The magnetic field \\( \\mathbf{B} \\) governs the motion of charged particles by bending their path. The force exerted by a magnetic field is perpendicular to both the velocity of the particle and the magnetic field direction. The electric field \\( \\mathbf{E} \\) can accelerate or decelerate particles, changing their velocity. The force exerted by an electric field acts in the direction of the field. In combination, these fields influence the particle's motion, leading to phenomena such as circular or helical paths in uniform magnetic fields or drift motion in crossed electric and magnetic fields. 2. Simulating Particle Motion The Lorentz force equation can be written as: \\[ \\mathbf{F} = q (\\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{v} \\times \\mathbf{B}) \\] where: - \\( q \\) is the charge of the particle, - \\( \\mathbf{E} \\) is the electric field, - \\( \\mathbf{B} \\) is the magnetic field, - \\( \\mathbf{v} \\) is the velocity of the particle. For the simulation, we will solve this equation numerically, applying methods such as the Euler or Runge-Kutta method to update the position and velocity of the particle at each time step. Scenarios to Simulate: Uniform Magnetic Field : A particle in a uniform magnetic field will undergo circular motion. The radius of the circle is called the Larmor radius. Combined Electric and Magnetic Fields : In this scenario, the particle will follow a helical path due to the combined forces of the electric and magnetic fields. Crossed Electric and Magnetic Fields : The particle will exhibit drift motion, such as the E \u00d7 B drift . Image for Simulating the Motion: 3. Parameter Exploration By adjusting the following parameters, we can explore the effect on the particle's motion: - Magnetic Field Strength ( \\( B \\) ) : Stronger fields result in smaller circular paths (shorter Larmor radius). - Electric Field Strength ( \\( E \\) ) : Electric fields accelerate or decelerate the particle, changing its velocity and trajectory. - Initial Velocity ( \\( \\mathbf{v}_0 \\) ) : The initial velocity affects the curvature of the trajectory. Higher velocities result in larger radii. - Charge and Mass ( \\( q, m \\) ) : The mass and charge of the particle influence its response to the forces. Lighter particles experience a greater deflection in the magnetic field. We can vary these parameters and observe how they influence the particle's motion and trajectory. 4. Visualization The Python code above provides a 2D visualization of the particle\u2019s trajectory in a uniform magnetic field. To observe phenomena like the Larmor radius and drift velocity , we can enhance the visualization by plotting in 3D or adding more complex field configurations. Larmor Radius : The radius of the circular motion of the particle in the magnetic field. It can be calculated using the formula: \\[ r_L = \\frac{mv}{qB} \\] Drift Velocity : When electric and magnetic fields are crossed, the particle exhibits drift motion perpendicular to both fields. The drift velocity can be expressed as: \\[ v_d = \\frac{E}{B} \\] Deliverables: Markdown Document : Contains an explanation of the Lorentz force, its applications, and the simulation. Python Script/Notebook : Implements the simulation and visualization of the particle's trajectory under various field configurations. Visualizations : Plots showing the particle's path in 2D (and optionally 3D) for different scenarios. Discussion : An analysis of how the results relate to practical systems such as cyclotrons, Tokamaks, and mass spectrometers, with suggestions for extending the simulation to more complex scenarios, like non-uniform fields. By varying the parameters, you can better understand the real-world applications of the Lorentz force, including the control of particles in accelerators, the separation of ions in mass spectrometers, and the confinement of plasma in fusion devices.","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/4%20Electromagnetism/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/4%20Electromagnetism/Problem_1/#simulating-the-effects-of-the-lorentz-force","text":"","title":"Simulating the Effects of the Lorentz Force"},{"location":"1%20Physics/4%20Electromagnetism/Problem_1/#1-exploration-of-applications","text":"The Lorentz force describes the force experienced by a charged particle moving through an electric ( \\( \\mathbf{E} \\) ) and magnetic ( \\( \\mathbf{B} \\) ) field.

The basic idea is to simplify the graph by identifying series and parallel resistor connections and reducing them until a single equivalent resistance is obtained. Here's a breakdown of how we can approach this problem: Key Concepts Series Connection : Resistors connected in series have the same current flowing through them, and their total resistance is the sum of their individual resistances. [ R_{\\text{eq}} = R_1 + R_2 + ... + R_n ] Parallel Connection : Resistors connected in parallel share the same voltage across them, and their total resistance is the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals of their individual resistances. [ \\frac{1}{R_{\\text{eq}}} = \\frac{1}{R_1} + \\frac{1}{R_2} + ... + \\frac{1}{R_n} ] Graph Representation : A resistor network can be represented as a graph, where nodes represent connection points, and edges represent resistors. Nested Connections : Combinations of series and parallel resistors can occur in complex structures, so the algorithm needs to handle cases where simplifications must be performed repeatedly. Explanation Identifying Series Connections : We begin by identifying series connections. This is done by finding edges in the graph that are connected in a single path. When we find them, we combine the resistors in that path by summing their individual resistances. Identifying Parallel Connections : Next, we look for parallel connections. Parallel resistors are typically grouped together where multiple resistors connect to the same pair of nodes. These resistors are combined using the formula for parallel resistance. Iterative Reduction : After simplifying series and parallel connections, we continue simplifying the graph until only one resistor remains. This iterative process handles nested combinations of resistors. Handling Nested Combinations : The algorithm works recursively, simplifying the graph at each step. Nested combinations are automatically handled because the algorithm looks for connections at every step, ensuring that each simplification is processed. Option 2: Advanced Task \u2013 Full Implementation In this option, you would implement the algorithm in a programming language (e.g., Python), leveraging a graph library like networkx to represent and manipulate the circuit graph. Here\u2019s an outline for how you might approach the implementation: Input Representation : Represent the circuit as a graph, where nodes are the connection points and edges represent resistors with their resistance values. Simplifying the Graph : Series Reduction : Look for nodes that are connected in a straight line (series). Combine their resistances by summing them. Parallel Reduction : Look for nodes that share a connection with multiple resistors (parallel). Combine their resistances by the reciprocal rule. Iterative Simplification : Repeat the series and parallel reductions until only one resistor remains in the graph. Handle Nested Configurations : Nested series and parallel configurations will naturally be simplified as the graph is reduced iteratively. Efficiency Considerations : Since the algorithm may require multiple graph traversals, performance could become an issue with large circuits. Using efficient graph traversal techniques (e.g., depth-first search or breadth-first search) could improve the performance. Python Example with networkx Here\u2019s a simple implementation using Python and networkx to handle graph simplification: Testing the Implementation You could test the implementation with examples like: - Simple series and parallel combinations, e.g., two resistors in series, two resistors in parallel. - Nested configurations, e.g., a series combination inside a parallel combination. - Complex graphs with multiple cycles and interconnections, ensuring the algorithm reduces the graph correctly. Algorithm Efficiency Time Complexity : The time complexity mainly depends on how many times we need to traverse and simplify the graph. In the worst case, for each edge, we might need to check series or parallel connections, resulting in O(E) complexity for each traversal, where E is the number of edges. Space Complexity : The space complexity is mainly O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices (nodes) and E is the number of edges in the graph.

Discussion: Sources of Uncertainty and Their Impact on the Results 1. Length Measurement Uncertainty ( \\(\\Delta L\\) ) The length of the pendulum ( \\(L\\) ) was measured using a ruler with a resolution of 2 mm. The associated uncertainty is taken as half the resolution: $$ \\Delta L = \\frac{\\text{resolution}}{2} = \\frac{0.002}{2} = 0.001\\ \\text{m} $$ Inaccuracies may also arise from not measuring from the exact pivot point or center of mass of the bob. Since gravitational acceleration is calculated as: $$ g = \\frac{4\\pi^2 L}{T^2} $$ a small error in \\(L\\) leads to a directly proportional error in \\(g\\) . 2. Timing Uncertainty ( \\(\\Delta t_{10}\\) ) Timing was done using a stopwatch, which introduces human reaction time errors (typically \u00b10.2 s for manual operation). To reduce the effect, the time for 10 oscillations was measured, and the mean value was calculated. The uncertainty in the mean time is: $$ \\Delta t_{10} = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{N}} $$ where \\(s\\) is the standard deviation and \\(N\\) is the number of trials. The uncertainty in the period is: $$ \\Delta T = \\frac{\\Delta t_{10}}{10} $$ 3. Propagation of Uncertainty in \\(g\\) From the formula: $$ g = \\frac{4\\pi^2 L}{T^2} $$ the relative uncertainty in \\(g\\) is: $$ \\frac{\\Delta g}{g} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\Delta L}{L}\\right)^2 + \\left(2 \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta T}{T}\\right)^2} $$ Timing uncertainty is squared and doubled in the equation, so small uncertainties in \\(T\\) have a larger impact on \\(g\\) than similar uncertainties in \\(L\\) . 4. Systematic Errors Angle of Displacement : If the initial angle exceeds about \\(15^\\circ\\) , the pendulum deviates from simple harmonic motion and the period increases, leading to an underestimated \\(g\\) . Air Resistance and Friction : Damping due to air drag and pivot friction slightly lengthens the period, also causing \\(g\\) to be underestimated.
