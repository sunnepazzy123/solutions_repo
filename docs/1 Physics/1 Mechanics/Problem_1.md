# Problem 1
 
### **Projectile Motion Description with Equations**  
 
Projectile motion describes the motion of an object launched into the air under the influence of gravity, following a curved trajectory called a **parabola**. It is analyzed as two separate motions in **horizontal** and **vertical** directions.
 
#### **1. Assumptions in Projectile Motion:**
 
- The only force acting on the projectile (neglecting air resistance) is **gravity** $g = 9.81 \, m/s^2$.
- The motion is **independent in horizontal and vertical directions**.
- The horizontal motion has **constant velocity** (no acceleration).
- The vertical motion has **uniform acceleration** due to gravity.

### **2. Equations of Motion:**
 
Let:
 
- $v_0$ = initial velocity  
- $\theta$ = launch angle  
- $v_{0x} = v_0 \cos\theta$ (initial horizontal velocity)  
- $v_{0y} = v_0 \sin\theta$ (initial vertical velocity)  
- $g = 9.81 \, m/s^2$ (acceleration due to gravity)  
- $t$ = time  
- $x$ = horizontal displacement  
- $y$ = vertical displacement
 
#### **Horizontal Motion (Constant Velocity):**  
$$
x = v_{0x} t = (v_0 \cos\theta) t
$$  
$$
v_x = v_0 \cos\theta
$$  
\(\Rightarrow\) No acceleration in the horizontal direction.
 
#### **Vertical Motion (Accelerated Motion due to Gravity):**  
$$
y = v_{0y} t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2
$$
$$
v_y = v_{0y} - g t
$$  
\(\Rightarrow\) Velocity decreases until the projectile reaches the highest point, then increases downward.

### **3. Key Parameters in Projectile Motion:**
 
#### **(a) Time of Flight** (Total time the projectile remains in the air)  
$$
T = \frac{2 v_0 \sin\theta}{g}
$$  
derived from setting $y = 0$ when the projectile lands
 
#### **(b) Maximum Height** (Highest point reached by the projectile)  
$$
H = \frac{(v_0 \sin\theta)^2}{2g}
$$  
(derived by setting $v_y = 0$ at the peak)
 
#### **(c) Range** (Total horizontal distance covered)  
$$
R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin 2\theta}{g}
$$  
(This is maximized when $\theta = 45^\circ $

### **4. Summary:**
- The **horizontal component** remains constant $x = v_{0x} t$
- The **vertical component** follows free-fall motion under gravity $y = v_{0y} t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2$.
- The **time of flight, maximum height, and range** depend on the initial velocity and angle of projection.
- The **trajectory is a symmetric parabola**.
